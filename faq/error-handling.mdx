# Error Handling

## Q: What to do when encountering a 401 error?

A: 401 indicates authentication failure, please check:

1. Whether the API key is correct
2. Header format: `Authorization: Bearer your-api-key`
3. Whether the key has expired or been deactivated

## Q: What to do when encountering a 429 error?

A: 429 indicates too frequent requests, solutions:

1. Reduce request frequency
2. Implement retry mechanism (exponential backoff recommended)
3. Contact technical support if you need higher rate limits

## Q: What to do when encountering a 500 error?

A: 500 indicates server error, please:

1. Retry later
2. Check if request parameters are correct
3. If it persists, contact technical support and provide request details

## Q: How to implement request retry?

A: Recommended retry strategy:

```python
import time
import random

def api_call_with_retry(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e

            # Exponential backoff + random jitter
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```
