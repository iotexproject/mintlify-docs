IoTeX AI Gateway is a unified AI model interface service that allows you to access multiple mainstream AI models — including Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, and more — through a single OpenAI-compatible API.

No need to register with individual AI providers. One endpoint, one API key — access every supported model instantly.

## How It Works

1. You send a request to `https://gateway.iotex.ai/v1/chat/completions` using any OpenAI-compatible client
2. IoTeX AI Gateway routes your request to the specified model provider
3. The response is returned in standard OpenAI format

```bash
curl https://gateway.iotex.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

<Note>
IoTeX AI Gateway is fully compatible with the OpenAI SDK. Any library or tool that supports the OpenAI API format can be used with zero code changes — just update the base URL and API key.
