## OpenAI SDK Compatibility

If you're already using the OpenAI SDK, switching to IoTeX AI Gateway takes two lines of code:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-iotex-api-key",          # Replace with your IoTeX API key
    base_url="https://gateway.iotex.ai/v1"  # Point to IoTeX AI Gateway
)

# Everything else stays the same
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```
